From Shake That Button, I chose to explore RR: The Headbanging Simulator and Une Partie de Tarot.

RR is a very fun aspect that very few people actually experience. The effort of growing out your hair to be long enough to properly headbang is a big commitment. However, I see RR more as a toy. The users seem to be playing with the idea of headbanging with no rules or score. I would have liked to see an integration of a fitbit into the wigs that tracks the amount of head banging or a sensor similar to Just Dance where the head banging has to be done at the right rhythm or style.

Une Partie de Tarot seems like a fun game. There is an end goal but is based on mostly random elements. It lets people experience what it's like being a tarot card reader and explores how invested and effective people's beliefs are.

# Level Assessment

I will be assessing a level in Borderlands 3, the dungeoun of Mouthpiece. In this level, you must kill the boss, Mouthpiece, while not dying to him or his minions. However, his level has an mechanic that is interestingly taught to the player. 

The game teaches the character throughout the dungeon leading up to the battle with Mouthpiece that speakers are traps and hurt. The player enters the dungeon and is met with the sight of a civilian encased in stone next to a speaker. They have been taught that breaking those civilians can drop loot so the player naturally will go up to break the object. Once the player gets to close, the speaker will go off breaking the object and hurting the player. 

Is it using one of Schell/Bond's Seven Methods of Indirect Guidance in an interesting way?
What is the Call to Action for the level
What is the quality of Direct Guidance (if present)
How effectively does the level build on a specific mechanic?
Does the level introduce a new mechanic? How does it teach it to the character?

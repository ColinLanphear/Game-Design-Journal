# Level Assessment

I will be assessing a level in Borderlands 3, the dungeoun of Mouthpiece. In this level, you must kill the boss, Mouthpiece, while not dying to him or his minions. However, his level has an mechanic that is interestingly taught to the player. 

The game teaches the character throughout the dungeon leading up to the battle with Mouthpiece that speakers are traps and hurt which is something the players have not seen. The player enters the dungeon and is met with the sight of a civilian encased in stone next to a speaker. They have been taught that breaking those civilians can drop loot so the player naturally will go up to break the object. Once the player gets to close, the speaker will go off breaking the object and hurting the player. Through out the dungeon, there are other speakers that are around while the player is in combat to keep the player on their toes. 

Once the player reaches the boss arena, they see that the whole arena is surronded by speakers and a little middle area with speakers as well except now they go off at Mouthpiece's command. The battle starts with Mouthpiece showing the player that this is the case by commanding the speakers farthest away from the player with audio and visual queues. 

Though it is relatively well executed, the actually boss battle does not do a great visaully showing the player where the speakers will hit during the heat of battle.
